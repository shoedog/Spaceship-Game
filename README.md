# Spaceship-Game
Text based game in C++. User must navigate rooms, collect items, and use items to escape the ship.

This project required me to use pointers to facilitate the representation of moving between different rooms in a ship.
I also created different items that were stored in rooms that the player can collect and needs to use to interact with other rooms.
The user has the goal to collect the correct items they need to escape the spaceship.
